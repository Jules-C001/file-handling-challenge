# File Handling Challenge üñãÔ∏è

## Overview
This project demonstrates **Python file handling** with robust **error handling**.  
The program reads content from an input file, modifies it, and writes the result to a new file. It ensures that common file errors are handled gracefully.

---

## Features
- Reads any text file specified by the user.
- Modifies content:
  - Converts all text to **uppercase**.
  - Replaces the word **"Python"** with **"PYTHON üêç"**.
- Writes the modified content to a new file.
- Handles errors:
  - File not found
  - Read/write issues
  - Unexpected errors
